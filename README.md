canvas.py (Cut ANd VAlidate Stamps) is a function which extracts postage stamps from COADD DES images. The code example.py shows how to call this function and produce stamps. 
The algorithm is part of the pipeline written to produce the DES Y1 Morphology Catalogue (Tarsitano et al., 2018). For more details see the publication http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/sty1970 .
If you use this code as a cutout service for your project, please cite the paper above in your publication.
